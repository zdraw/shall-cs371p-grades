Takes in input of the number of events (a positive int)
the max values of the events (several positive ints)
the weights of the events (several positive ints) (that add up to 100)
the following for each student
the ID (a 5-char String)
the unique (a 5-digit positive int)
the TA name (a max 8-char String)
the scores (several non-negative ints) (<= to the corresponding max value)

Ouputs the the number of events (a positive int)
the max values of the events (several positive ints)
the weights of the events (several positive ints) (that add up to 100)
Size: the number of students (a positive int)
Max: the max of the total scores as a percent (a non-negative double) (rounded to two decimal places)
Mean: the mean of the total scores as a percent (a non-negative double) (rounded to two decimal places)
Min: the min of the total scores as a percent (a non-negative double) (rounded to two decimal places)
For each letter grade (A, B, C, D, F): the number and percent of students with that letter grade (a non-negative int and a non-negative double) (rounded to two decimal places)
GPA: the GPA of the whole class (a non-negative double) (A = 4pts, B = 3pts, C = 2pts, D = 1pt, F = 0pts)
the following for each student
